                                        Below are some recommendations from colleagues and supervisors I've had the pleasure of working with.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="recommendation">
                                        <div class="recommendation-text">
                                            <p>
                                                I am truly pleased to recommend Joaquim as a highly skilled software developer and machine learning engineer. I have known Joaquim since 2019, when he was pursuing his M.Sc. at EPFL. Our first collaboration was during a semester project, where he developed an innovative deep learning architecture and successfully demonstrated its superior performance. Later, I had the privilege of supervising his Master's thesis, which tackled a creative approach to constructing neural network functionalities. Even after his thesis, we continued working closely together for another year, pushing the boundaries of research in this area. Our efforts have resulted in four published journal papers, with Joaquim being the lead author on two.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Joaquim consistently impressed me with his intelligence, discipline, and pragmatic approach. He is highly results-oriented, with a “get things done” mindset that is invaluable when navigating complex challenges or rapidly iterating on new ideas. His proactive nature, coupled with his creativity, enables him to come up with original solutions and approaches that others may overlook.
                                            </p>
                                                Beyond his technical expertise, Joaquim is an absolute pleasure to work with. He is thoughtful, kind, and patient, making collaboration both productive and enjoyable. His excellent communication skills, both verbal and written, allow him to express complex ideas clearly, and he is always receptive to feedback. I cannot speak highly enough of his character, professionalism, and dedication—he is truly an outstanding individual.
                                            </p>
