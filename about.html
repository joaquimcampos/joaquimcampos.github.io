									<p>
										I am an engineer and researcher specializing in signal processing and artificial intelligence, as well as a Python developer. In academia, my focus has been on deep learning, learning theory, image and video compression, and inverse problems. Additionally, I am Co-Founder of Radiobooks, a startup that assists independent authors and self-learners in automatically converting their books into audiobooks using AI. Through this venture, I am gaining knowledge in product development and Python DevOps.

									<!-- My approach is deeply influenced by meditationâ€”the process of directly investigating and working the mind. -->
									<!-- two-and-a-half-year -->
									<p>
										Outside the scope of my scientific expertise, I dedicate my time to exploring philosophy, psychology, meditation, ethics, and social systems. I find joy in tackling problems holistically, drawing inspiration from both ancient and modern wisdom, and considering the entire pipeline from philosophical and scientific inquiry to practical application.
										I appreciate engaging in thoughtful discussions, being exposed to different points of view, andâ€”when suitableâ€”sharing the little I know with others.
										<!-- Currently, I am enrolled in a Buddhist philosophy and meditation course at the <a href="https://tergarinstitute.org/program/" target="_blank">Tergar Insitute</a>, which will continue on-site between mid-September and mid-December this year (2024). -->

									<p>
										Having started traveling at a young age, I've been fortunate to have explored more than 30 countries. I speak
										Portuguese and
										<!-- <span class="fi fi-pt"></span> -->
										English fluently,
										<!-- <span class="fi fi-gb"></span> -->
										have a conversational level of Spanish,
										<!-- <span class="fi fi-es"></span> -->
										and I can get by in French.
										<!-- <span class="fi fi-fr"></span> -->
									</p>
									<p>
										I'm actively seeking new job opportunities. However, please note that I will not be available between September 11 and December 11 this year, as I'll be attending a course on Buddhist philosophy and meditation in Kathmandu, Nepal. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my profile.

								    <p>
								    	My expertise spans both theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning, deep learning, and signal processing, as well as Python development. Additionally, during my academic years, I honed valuable presentation, writing, and teaching skills, much of which I owe to Prof. Michael Unser. In DevOps, I have experience with Python, C, FastAPI, Pytest, PyTorch, CI/CD, Bash, Linux, MongoDB, Docker, Github Actions, Codecov, AWS, and Fly.io.

										<h2>Biography</h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/" target="_blank">Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico - University of Lisbon</a>, Portugal, in 2016. I then moved abroad to pursue a Master's degree in Communication Systems at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" target="_blank">Ã‰cole PolytÃ©chnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne</a> (EPFL), Switzerland, specializing in <i>Signals, Images, and Interfaces</i>. During my Master's, I did a internship at <a href="https://studios.disneyresearch.com/" target="_blank">Disney Research</a>, Zurich, where I developed new algorithms for <a href="compression.html" target="_blank">neural image and video compression</a>. After the programme's completion, I joined EPFL's <a href="https://bigwww.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">Biomedical Imaging Group</a>, where I conducted research on regularization methods for <a href="deepsplines.html" target="_blank">deep learning</a> and <a href="htv.html" target="_blank">classical supervised learning</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Unser"> Professor Michael Unser</a>. During this time, I was also a teaching assistant for the courses <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/en/bachelor/microengineering/coursebook/signals-and-systems-i-for-mt-MICRO-310-A">Signals and Systems I</a> and <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/en/bachelor/microengineering/coursebook/signals-and-systems-ii-for-mt-MICRO-311-A">Signals and Systems II</a>. I then joined <a href="radiobooks.html" target="_blank">Radiobooks</a>, a start-up that utilizes AI to convert books into audiobooks, in the role of Co-Founder and DevOps Engineer.
