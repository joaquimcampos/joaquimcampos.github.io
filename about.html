									<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
									<p>
										I am an engineer, programmer, and researcher specialized in signal processing and artificial intelligence. Professionally, I have engaged with deep learning, learning theory, image and video compression, and inverse problems. The joint research I have conducted with my colleagues at Disney and EPFL has resulted in the publication of seven scientific papers with over 300 citations, as well as three granted patents. Additionally, I co-founded Radiobooks, a company utilizing AI to convert books into audiobooks, where I developed a Python application.
									</p>
									<p>
										Outside the scope of my scientific expertise, I dedicate my time to exploring philosophy, psychology, meditation, ethics, and social systems. I find joy in tackling problems holistically, drawing inspiration from both ancient and modern wisdom, and considering the entire pipeline from philosophical and scientific inquiry to practical application.
										<!-- My approach is deeply influenced by meditation—the process of directly investigating and working the mind. -->
										I appreciate engaging in thoughtful discussions, being exposed to different points of view, and—when suitable—sharing the little I know with others. Currently, I am enrolled in a
										<!-- two-and-a-half-year -->
										Buddhist philosophy and meditation course at the <a href="https://tergarinstitute.org/program/" target="_blank">Tergar Insitute</a>, which will continue on-site between mid-September and mid-December this year (2024).

										Having started traveling at a young age, I've been fortunate to have explored more than 30 countries. I speak
										Portuguese and

										<!-- <span class="fi fi-es"></span> -->

									<p>
										I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/" target="_blank">Instituto Superior Técnico - University of Lisbon</a>, Portugal, in 2016. I then moved abroad to pursue a Master's degree in Communication Systems at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" target="_blank">École Polytéchnique Fédérale de Lausanne</a> (EPFL), Switzerland, specializing in <i>Signals, Images, and Interfaces</i>. During my Master's, I did a internship at <a href="https://studios.disneyresearch.com/" target="_blank">Disney Research</a>, Zurich, where I developed new algorithms for <a href="compression.html" target="_blank">neural image and video compression</a>. After the programme's completion, I joined EPFL's <a href="https://bigwww.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">Biomedical Imaging Group</a>, where I conducted research on regularization methods for <a href="deepsplines.html" target="_blank">deep learning</a> and <a href="htv.html" target="_blank">classical supervised learning</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Unser"> Professor Michael Unser</a>. During this time, I was also a teaching assistant for the courses <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/en/bachelor/microengineering/coursebook/signals-and-systems-i-for-mt-MICRO-310-A">Signals and Systems I</a> and <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/en/bachelor/microengineering/coursebook/signals-and-systems-ii-for-mt-MICRO-311-A">Signals and Systems II</a>. I then joined <a href="radiobooks.html" target="_blank">Radiobooks</a>, a start-up that converts text documents to speech using AI, in the role of Co-Founder.
