    While there are many deep learning based approaches for single image compression, the field of end-to-end learned video coding has remained much less explored. Therefore, in this work we present an inter-frame compression approach for neural video coding that can seamlessly build up on different existing neural image codecs. Our end-to-end solution performs temporal prediction by optical flow based motion compensation in pixel space. The key insight is that we can increase both decoding efficiency and reconstruction quality by encoding the required side information into a latent representation that directly decodes into motion and blending coefficients. In order to account for remaining prediction errors, residual information between the original image and the interpolated frame is needed. We propose to compute residuals directly in latent space instead of in pixel space as this allows to reuse the same image compression network for both key frames and intermediate frames. This has the advantage of making our video coding approach, more coherent, more memory efficient, and easier to train. Our extended evaluation on different datasets and resolutions shows that the rate-distortion performance of our approach is competitive with existing state-of-the-art codecs.

    Conclusion: <br>
    Our neural video coding framework is able to achieve re-
    sults competitive with existing video codecs that have wit-
    nessed several decades of engineering improvements. This
    is in particular due to the interpolation approach that em-
    beds compression constraints and takes advantage of all
    the available information at encoding time. In addition to
    this, expressing residuals in latent space simplifies the video
    compression task as the same network is used both for key-
    frames and residuals. In this work, we have focused on
    compressing intermediate frames that rely on key frames in
    the past and future. However, our approach is also com-
    patible with other settings such as only frames from the
    past. Thus finding optimal strategies for key frame selec-
    tion would be an interesting branch of future work.

    Abstract: <br>
    The field of neural image compression has witnessed
    exciting progress as recently proposed architectures al-
    ready surpass the established transform coding based ap-
    proaches. While, so far, research has mainly focused on
    architecture and model improvements, in this work we ex-
    plore content adaptive optimization. To this end, we intro-
    duce an iterative procedure which adapts the latent repre-
    sentation to the specific content we wish to compress while
    keeping the parameters of the network and the predictive
    model fixed. Our experiments show that this allows for an
    overall increase in rate-distortion performance, indepen-
    dently of the specific architecture used. Furthermore, we
    also evaluate this strategy in the context of adapting a pre-
    trained network to other content that is different in visual
    appearance or resolution. Here, our experiments show that
    our adaptation strategy can largely close the gap as com-
    pared to models specifically trained for the given content
    while having the benefit that no additional data in the form
    of model parameter updates has to be transmitted.
    <br> <br>
    Conclusion: <br>
    In this work we have investigated content adaptive com-
    pression strategies which can be seen as a complementary
    approach of improving neural image coding besides archi-
    tecture refinements. More specifically, we have presented
    a latent space refinement algorithm that allows to improve
    quality by roughly 0.5 dB at the same bit rate on the Tecnick
    data set. This strategy also allows to significantly close the
    gap between generic pre-trained models and models that are
    specifically trained for a given target content.Thus, the la-
    tent space adaptation can be an effective strategy to make a
    given encoding process more powerful and content adap-
    tive. This is particularly beneficial in situations such as
    streaming, where the encoding complexity is not the limit-
    ing factor when compared to the transmission and decoding.
    As the gap towards models that are entirely trained on the
    specific target content cannot fully be closed, it would be
    interesting to further investigate which more complex but
    still practically viable form of adaptation may achieve this.
    Also currently, neural image compression models are typi-
    cally trained for each rate-distortion point and it would be
    similarly beneficial to investigate strategies that allow auto-
    matic adaptation to each quality level.
