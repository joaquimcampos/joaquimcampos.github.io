<p>
    Radiobooks is a start-up that converts ebooks into audiobooks using AI.
    Our software consists of an editing studio that gives users ample control over the generated audio, allowing them to customize it to fit your requirements. We are focused on creating a well-designed, easy and intuitive user experience.
</p>
<h4 class="subsection">How It Works</h4>
<p>
    First, you can create a project by uploading an EPUB or PDF file and choosing a narration voice from a large selection of languages.
    Then, we run algorithms that analyze the submitted document&mdash;detecting images, tables, chapters, page numbers, etc.&mdash;and automatically identify which content should be read or not (for example, the details of the publisher are automatically left out).
    Once this is finished, you can listen to the generated audios (one per paragraph) and make appropriate changes:
    modify a particular piece of text, add pauses, change the narration voice, audio speed, pitch, and volume, etc.
    When you're satisfied with the result, you can download the full generated audio or just a few chapters for listening on-the-go.
</p>
<h4 class="subsection">The Motivation</h4>
<p>
    The classical way of converting a book into an audiobook involves renting a studio,
    hiring a voice actor and a sound engineer, and going through a
    recording-and-correction back-and-forth that usually lasts several months.
    As a consequence, only famous authors stand a chance of ever having their books
    converted into audio. Small and independent authors, and authors from less
    technologically developed countries, on the other hand, can only dream about it...
</p>
<p>
    Since the end result of classical human narration is obviously preferable to that of AI narration, the books that can be converted by classical means will continue to be; however, they represent a small fraction of all existent books.
    Even if we take finances out of the equation, there is just too much written content and not enough people and time to convert it into audio.
</p>
<p>
    Less than 1% of all books are converted into audio, and the great majority of them are in English.
    Our aim is to facilitate the conversion of all the books that would never be converted without this kind of technology (the other 99%). With that, we hope to improve education worldwide, and help content creators, small and independent authors, and authors in less technologically developed countries.
    All in all, we are hoping that our product becomes an example of ethical AI.
    <!-- and to the literature student who doesn't have time to read all of the books in the curriculum. -->

<h4 class="subsection">My Contribution</h4>
<p>
    I am a Co-Founder and CTO of Radiobooks.
    My role in this project has been to create the backend infrastructure; this includes developing and implementing the required algorithms, writing test suites, and managing CI-CD pipelines, cloud deployment, cloud storage, and database management.
    Moreover, as CTO, I am working with the development team, talking with clients, and riding the usual startup rollercoaster, with all its ups and downs.
</p>
<p>
    I added a few code samples from the project's backend in this
