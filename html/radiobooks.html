    Radiobooks is a start-up that converts books into audiobooks using AI.
    Converting a book into audiobook costs a lot of money and time, and human resources.
    And there are just too many books!
    As a result, less than 1% of the books are converted into audio, and the great
    majority is in english.
    Books that do not have a high degree of exposure do not stand a
    chance of ever being converted. Most small and independent authors
    therefore do not have any option.
</p>
<p>
    We see this project as an example of ethical AI. Famous books will always be
    converted by human narrators, but are a tiny fraction of all existent books.
    Our vision is to improve education worldwide by converting books to audio that would
    not be converted otherwise.
    We are aiming towards helping
    Independent authors,
    authors in developing countries with less financial resources,
    and the literature student who doesn't have time to read all of the books in the
    curriculum.

    Our software consists of an editing studio that gives users ample control over the generated audio, allowing them to customize their audiobooks to fit their requirements.
    Using our software, users can create a project by uploading an .EPUB or .PDF file, and choosing a language and voice from a wide selection.
    We then run algorithms that analyze the submitted document&mdash;detecting images, tables, chapters, page numbers, etc.&mdash;and automatically identify which content should be read or not (for example, the details of the publisher are automatically left out.)
    Once this is finished, the user can listen to the generated audios and make appropriate changes:
    modify the text, add pauses, change the voice, audio speed, pitch, and volume, for a given block, etc.
    At the end, the user can download the full generated audio or just a few chapters for listening to it wherever they wish.

    My role in this project has been to create the backend infrastructure. This includes developing and implementing the required algorithms, writing test suites, and managing CI-CD pipelines, cloud deployment, cloud storage, and database management.
    Moreover, as CTO, I am leading the development team, talking with clients, and riding the usual startup rollercoaster, with all its ups and downs.

    I added a few code samples from the project's backend in this
