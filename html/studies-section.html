                This on-going course is being taught by <a href="https://tergarinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Tergar Institute</a> in a hybrid fashion: partly in person (at <a href="https://www.tergarsangha.org/" target="_blank">Tergar Osel Ling</a>, Nepal), and partly online. The header teacher is <a href="https://tergar.org/about-2/mingyur-rinpoche/" target="_blank">Mingyur Rinpoche</a>. This Master's is using contemporary teaching approaches to convey the ancient wisdom of Buddhist philosophy and meditation.
