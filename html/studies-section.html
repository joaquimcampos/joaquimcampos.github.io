            <h3>Course in Buddhist Philosophy and Meditation, <span>Tergar Institute</span></h3>
            <p>
                This on-going course is being taught by the <a href="https://tergarinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Tergar Institute</a> in a hybrid fashion: partly in person (at <a href="https://www.tergarsangha.org/" target="_blank">Tergar Osel Ling</a>, Nepal), and partly online. The header teacher is <a href="https://tergar.org/about-2/mingyur-rinpoche/" target="_blank">Mingyur Rinpoche</a>. The program employs modern teaching methods to convey the ancient wisdom of Buddhist philosophy and meditation. Being newly-founded, the Institute is currently seeking certification; I had the privilege of being part of its inaugural cohort. The description of my independent study project can be found <a href="madhyamaka.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
