    I have long been interested in philosophy, psychology, and meditation.
    And it has now become ever more clear to me that the knowledge within these fields
    is sorely needed for rethinking our goals as a society, especially when it comes to
    technology.
<p>
</p>
    We have become so used to mindlessly pursuing technological
    progress that we now seem to unconsciously equate it with progress itself.
    But what do we define as progress after all?
    What are we really trying to achieve?
    Are we improving our well-being, becoming happier, and more connected?
    Are we building more ethical and sustainable products?
    Is technological development truly advancing our deeper societal goals,
    or is it (in some cases) turning us into victims of our own "success"?
    Shouldn't our definition of progress also encompass environmental health as well as
    take into account the lives of non-human beings?
    <!-- Is not bearing to stay away from our phones for more than a few hours -->
    <!-- what we wanted to achieve? -->
</p>    
<p>
    These are some of the questions that have been capturing my imagination for the
    past few years. To address them, while continuing my work in science and technology 
    I am also stepping foot in other domains of knowledge.
</p>
<p>
    As part of this exploration, in September, I will join a 3-month-long intensive study
    program on buddhist philosophy and meditation.
