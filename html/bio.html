<div class="last-element">
<p>
    I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer
    Engineering at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">
    Instituto Superior Técnico - University of Lisbon</a>, Portugal, in 2016.
    I then moved abroad to pursue a Master's degree in Communication Systems at
    <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">École Polytéchnique
    Fédérale de Lausanne</a> (EPFL), Switzerland, specializing in
    <i>Signals, Images, and Interfaces</i>. During my Master's, I did a internship at
    <a href="https://studios.disneyresearch.com/">Disney Research</a>, Zurich,
    where I developed new algorithms for <a href="/#/projects#image-video-comp">
    neural image and video compression</a>.
    After the programme's completion, I joined EPFL's <a href="http://bigwww.epfl.ch/">
    Biomedical Imaging Group</a>,
    where I conducted research on regularization methods for
    <a href="/#/projects#htv">classical supervised learning</a> and
    <a href="/#/projects#deepsplines">deep learning</a>,
    under the supervision of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Unser">
    Professor Michael Unser</a>. During this time, I was
    also teaching assistant in the courses
    <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/signaux-et-systemes-i-pour-mt-MICRO-310-A">
    MICRO-310 Signals and Systems I</a> and
    <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/signaux-et-systemes-ii-pour-mt-MICRO-311-A">
    MICRO-311 Signals and Systems II</a>.

    The research that I have conducted with my colleagues
    at Disney and EPFL has lead to the publication of seven academic papers,
    which have been <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GT-VCroAAAAJ&hl=pt-PT">
    cited over 250 times</a> in the scientific literature, and to the registration of three US patents
