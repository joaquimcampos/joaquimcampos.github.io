<h2> Professional Biography</h2>

<!-- <h4>Some header</h4> -->
<p>
    I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer
    Engineering at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">
    Instituto Superior Técnico - University of Lisbon</a>, Portugal, in 2016.
    I then moved abroad to pursue a Master's degree in Communication Systems at
    <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">École Polytéchnique
    Fédérale de Lausanne</a> (EPFL), Switzerland, specializing in
    <i>Signals, Images, and Interfaces</i>. During my Master's, I did a internship at
    <a href="https://studios.disneyresearch.com/">Disney Research</a>, Zurich,
    where I developed new algorithms for <a href="/#/projects#image-video-comp">
    neural image and video compression</a>.
    After the programme's completion, I joined EPFL's <a href="http://bigwww.epfl.ch/">
    Biomedical Imaging Group</a>,
    where I conducted research on regularization methods for
    <a href="/#/projects#htv">classical supervised learning</a> and
    <a href="/#/projects#deepsplines">deep learning</a>,
    under the supervision of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Unser">
    Professor Michael Unser</a>. During this time, I was
    also teaching assistant in the courses
    <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/signaux-et-systemes-i-pour-mt-MICRO-310-A">
    MICRO-310 Signals and Systems I</a> and
    <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/signaux-et-systemes-ii-pour-mt-MICRO-311-A">
    MICRO-311 Signals and Systems II</a>.

<p>
    The research that I have conducted with my colleagues
    at Disney and EPFL has lead to the publication of seven academic papers,
    which have been <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GT-VCroAAAAJ&hl=pt-PT">
    cited over 250 times</a> in the scientific literature, and to the registration of three US patents
    [<a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/10972749">1</a>,

    Currently, I am Co-Founder and CTO at <a href="https://www.radiobooks.io/">Radiobooks</a>,
    a company that converts ebooks into audiobooks automatically using artificial intelligence.

<h3> What's Ahead </h3>

<p>
    I have long been interested in philosophy, psychology, and meditation;
    it has now become ever more clear to me that these fields are sorely
    needed for rethinking our goals as a society, especially when it comes to the
    field of technology.
    It seems to me that we have become so used to tirelessly pursuing technological progress
    that we now uncosciously equate it with progress itself.
    <!-- Jumping from one technological trend to the next, we rarely stop to ask the "why". -->
</p>
<p>
    What do we define as progress after all? What we are trying to achieve? <br>
    <!-- Is not bearing to stay away from our phones for more than a few hours -->
    <!-- what we wanted to achieve? <br> -->
    Are the products we are building ethical and sustainable? <br>
    Are we becoming happier, more connected? <br>
    What is happiness after all? The mere temporary fulfillment of all our desires or
    something deeper? <br>
    Are we improving our well-being, and developing healthier relationships with
    ourselves, those around us, and the environment? <br>
    Is technological development truly advancing our deeper goals as a society
    or are we becoming victims of our own "success"? <br>
    Are we all benefitting or just a few us?
</p>    
<p>
    These are some of the questions that are capturing my imagination at the moment,
    and that I will explore in the future alongside my my work in science and technology,
    by stepping foot in other domains of knowledge. As part of this effort,
    I decided to join a 3-month-long intensive study program on buddhist philosophy
    and meditation in September.
