<p>
    In 2016, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer
    Engineering from <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/" target="_blank">
    Instituto Superior Técnico</a> (Universidade de Lisboa), Lisbon, Portugal.
    I then pursued a Master's in Communication Systems at
    <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" target="_blank">École Polytéchnique
    Fédérale de Lausanne</a> (EPFL), Switzerland, specializing in
    <i>Signals, Images, and Interfaces</i>.

    During the Master's, I worked as a Research Intern at
    <a href="https://studios.disneyresearch.com/" target="_blank">Disney Research</a>,
    Zurich.
    After the programme's completion, I conducted research on signal processing
    at EPFL's <a href="http://bigwww.epfl.ch/" target="_blank"> Biomedical Imaging Group</a>,
    under the supervision of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Unser" target="_blank">
    Prof. Michael Unser</a>, until the end of 2021. During this period, I was
    also a teaching assistant in the courses
    <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/signaux-et-systemes-i-pour-mt-MICRO-310-A" target="_blank">
    MICRO-310 Signals and Systems I</a> and
    <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/signaux-et-systemes-ii-pour-mt-MICRO-311-A" target="_blank">
    MICRO-311 Signals and Systems II</a>. The research that I have conducted with my colleagues
    at Disney and EPFL has lead to the publication of seven academic papers,
    which have been <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GT-VCroAAAAJ&hl=pt-PT" target="_blank">
    cited over 250 times</a> in the scientific literature, and to the registration of three US patents
