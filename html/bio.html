<!-- <h4>Some header</h4> -->
<p>
    I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer
    Engineering at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">
    Instituto Superior Técnico - University of Lisbon</a>, Portugal, in 2016.
    I then moved abroad to pursue a Master's degree in Communication Systems at
    <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">École Polytéchnique
    Fédérale de Lausanne</a> (EPFL), Switzerland, specializing in
    <i>Signals, Images, and Interfaces</i>. During my Master's, I did a internship at
    <a href="https://studios.disneyresearch.com/">Disney Research</a>, Zurich,
    where I developed new algorithms for <a href="/#/projects#image-video-comp">
    neural image and video compression</a>.
    After the programme's completion, I joined EPFL's <a href="http://bigwww.epfl.ch/">
    Biomedical Imaging Group</a>,
    where I conducted research on regularization methods for
    <a href="/#/projects#htv">classical supervised learning</a> and
    <a href="/#/projects#deepsplines">deep learning</a>,
    under the supervision of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Unser">
    Professor Michael Unser</a>. During this time, I was
    also teaching assistant in the courses
    <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/signaux-et-systemes-i-pour-mt-MICRO-310-A">
    MICRO-310 Signals and Systems I</a> and
    <a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/signaux-et-systemes-ii-pour-mt-MICRO-311-A">
    MICRO-311 Signals and Systems II</a>.

    The research that I have conducted with my colleagues
    at Disney and EPFL has lead to the publication of seven academic papers,
    which have been <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GT-VCroAAAAJ&hl=pt-PT">
    cited over 250 times</a> in the scientific literature, and to the registration of three US patents

    Currently, I am Co-Founder and CTO at <a href="https://www.radiobooks.io/">Radiobooks</a>,
    a company that converts ebooks into audiobooks automatically using artificial intelligence.

<p>
    I have long been interested in philosophy, psychology, and meditation.
    And it has now become ever more clear to me that the knowledge within these fields
    is sorely needed for rethinking our goals as a society, especially when it comes to
    technology.
    We have become so used to mindlessly pursuing technological
    progress that it seems to me we now unconsciously equate it with
    progress itself.
    But what do we define as progress after all?
    What are we trying to achieve? What is the end-goal?
    Are we improving our well-being, becoming happier, more connected?
    Is technological development truly advancing our societal goals,
    or is it, in some cases, turning us into victims of our own "success"?
    Shouldn't our definition of progress also encompass environmental health and the
    lives of other sentient beings with whom we share the planet with?
    Are the products that we're building ethical and sustainable?
    <!-- Is not bearing to stay away from our phones for more than a few hours -->
    <!-- what we wanted to achieve? -->
</p>    
<p>
    These are some of the questions that have been capturing my imagination for the
    past few years. To address them, while continuing my work in science and technology 
    I am also stepping foot in the other domains of knowledge.
    As part of this exploration, I decided to join a 3-month-long intensive study program
    on buddhist philosophy and meditation in September.
