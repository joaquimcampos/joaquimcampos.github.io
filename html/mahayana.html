<h4 class="subsection">Introduction: Western Ethics</h4>
<p>
    Western ethical views are usually summarized into three main theories: deontology, consequentialism,
    and virtue ethics [<a href="" ng-click="scrollToElement('footnote-other-theories')">1</a>,
    <a href="" ng-click="scrollToElement('footnote-western-theories')">2</a>].
<!-- </p>
<p> -->
    The first, deontology, holds that ethics should be based on moral norms (categorical rules of prohibition or permissiveness) and not on the potential or actual consequences of an action.
    For example, deontologists would generally hold that the act of killing an inocent person
    is never right, independently of any "positive" effects that it might have (such as saving five other people).
    In this sense, the Right is said to have priority over the Good <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/#DeoThe">[2]</a>.
<!-- </p>
<p> -->
    The second, consequentialism, holds that ethics should be based not on moral norms but on
    what maximizes the "greater Good" (for which definitions might vary).
    According to this system, moral choices should be weighed in a context-aware manner according their potential consequences;
    an action such as killing might be considered wrong
    in a given situation but right in another, depending on whether it has
    "positive" or "negative" consequences.
<!-- </p>
<p> -->
    Finally, virtue ethics holds that what matters for determinining the moral character
    of an action is not whether it follows "good" moral norms or leads to a greater ratio
    of "positive" vs "negative" consequences,
    but whether it is aligned with wholesome virtues such as compassion, honesty, etc.;
    an action such as killing might be considered wrong if it is arises from
    an unvirtuous attitude (<i>e.g.</i>, hatred), but be right if it is motivated by
    an virtuous one (<i>e.g.</i>, compassion).

    [1] There are theories which do not fit into this classification like

    [2] Each of the theories mentioned here encompasses several sub-theories.
    For the purposes of this piece, I will make a few rough generalizations.
