<h4 class="subsection">Introduction: Western Ethics</h4>
<p>
    There are three main western ethical theories: deontology, consequentialism,
    and virtue ethics <a href="" ng-click="scrollToElement('footnote-western-theories')">[1]</a>.
    Deontology works with moral norms, categorical rules of prohibition or permissiveness,
    instead of looking at the effects of an action.
    Deontologists would hold that killing an inocent person is never right, independently
    of the "positive" effects that this might have (e.g. saving other five).
    Some deontological theories hold that lying is never permissible, even if it is to save someone.
    In this sense, the Right takes precedence over the Good.
</p>
<p>
    Consequentialists, on the other hand, are not concerned with moral norms but with
    maximizing the greater Good, even if definitions of what that means might vary.
    As the name says, Consequences matter. So, the same action (for example, lying) might be wrong
    in a given circumstance but it might be right in another, depending on whether it leads
    to bad or good consequences.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, virtue ethicists are not concerned with moral norms nor consequences.
    They hold that what matters for determinining the moral character of an action is
    whether it is aligned with good virtues, such as compassion, honesty, etc.
    In that case, the same action (e.g. lying) might be considered good if it is motivated by
    virtuous intentions (compassion), but be bad if it is motivated by unvirtuous ones
    (e.g. self-centeredness).
