    The classification of Mahayana Buddhist (MB) ethics into the western deontological, virtue-based, and consequentialist subdivisions has divided scholars in recent years. At the heart of this discussion lies the presence of elements from these three categories in MB, which has led to questions on compability, precedence, and interpretation.

    In this paper, we argue for a consequentialist classification of MB ethics and use the lens of Optimization Theory to clarify how the different aspects of MB, including precepts (deontological elements) and virtues, fit within this classification. We proceed as follows: First, we draw upon the central MB concept of the bodhisattva vow---the commitment to attain Nirvana for the benefit of all sentient beings---to propose a consequentialist framework for MB whose utility function is the cumulative progress of all sentient beings towards the elimination of the roots of suffering, namely ignorance, attachment, and aversion (also known as the <i>three poisons</i>). Second, we restate the problem in the language of Optimization Theory and analyze the role that precepts and virtues, skillful means, and spiritual guides play in MB by enquirying about their function with regards to the navigation of the optimization landscape; Finally, we explore different mathematical questions that are commonplace in the field of Optimization Theory, and use them as a basis for studying MB's ethical framework.
