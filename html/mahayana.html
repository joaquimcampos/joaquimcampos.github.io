<h4 class="subsection">Introduction: Western Ethics</h4>
<p>
    There are three main western ethical theories: deontology, consequentialism,
    and virtue ethics <a href="" ng-click="scrollToElement('footnote-western-theories')">[1]</a>.
    The first, deontology, holds that ethics should be based on moral norms&mdash;categorical rules of prohibition or permissiveness&mdash;and not on the effects of an action.
    For example, deontologists would generally hold that the act of killing an inocent person
    is never right, independently of the "positive" effects that this might have (e.g. saving other five).
    In this sense, the Right is said to have priority over the Good <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/#DeoThe">[2]</a>.
    Consequentialists, on the other hand, are not concerned with moral norms but with
    maximizing the "greater Good" (even if views of what the "greater Good" means might vary).
    As the name says, according to this system, Consequences matter.
    So, an action such as killing might be wrong
    in a given situation but be right in another depending on whether it leads
    to bad or good consequences.
    Finally, virtue ethicists are not concerned with .
    They hold that what matters for determinining the moral character of an action is
    not whether it follows good moral norms or has good consequences,
    but whether it is aligned with wholesome virtues (such as compassion, honesty, etc.)
    In that case, an action such as killing might be considered good if it is arises from
    a virtuous attitude (<i>e.g.</i>, compassion), but be bad if it is motivated by
    an unvirtuous one (e.g. hatred).
