<h4>This Project, Simply Explained</h4>
<p>
    Suppose we have a dataset \({\mathrm D}\) with \(M\) datapoints, where each datapoint is a pair
    of inputs and their corresponding values&mdash;mathematically, we write this statement
    as \({\mathrm D} = \lbrace{\mathbf x}_m, y_m\rbrace _{m=1}^M\).
    This dataset might be, for example, a sequence of images of mountains and their
    corresponding height in meters, as depicted below.
</p>

</div>
<p>
    Continuing with the previous example, in supervised learning our goal is to find a model \(f\) that predicts the height \(y_m\) of each image \({\mathbf x}_m\) in our dataset fairly well <a href="" ng-click="scrollToElement('footnote-1')">[1]</a>
    (<i>i.e.</i>, \(f({\bf x}_m) = \hat{y}_m \approx y_m\)),
    and that is able to generalize to new inputs. Specifically, we want our model to accurately predict
    the height of a mountain whose image it has not
    seen before (<i>i.e.</i> is not present the training data). This is what learning is all about.
</p>
<p>
    In general, this a very difficult puzzle to solve, because there are infinite models
    that could fit the data, and very few actually make sense.
    Therefore, we need to introduce some information to solve the problem.
<!-- </p>
<p> -->
    First, if we know some prior information about the data distribution, then we can use
    it. For example, if the data is the result of a linear mapping plus
    some observation noise, <i>i.e.</i>, \(y = {\mathbf w}^T{\mathbf x} + b + \epsilon\),
    then we can just search within family of models and just by trying to find
    the optimal parameters \({\mathbf w}\) and \(b\). In this way, we transform an
    a priori very complicated (infinite-dimensional) problem into a very simple
    (finite-dimensional) one. Alternatively, we might search restrict ourselves to a family
    of models that we know usually works for similar tasks.
    Finally, we might also want to favor simple models, following the Occam's razor principle:
    as long as it can do the job, the simpler, the better.
    Simple models have the advantage of being faster to use,
    ocupying less memory and being more robust.
    Moreover, they are more explainable, since with less parameters the influence of
    each one in the final result becomes easier to understand.
    So we actually understand what is going on (unlike with ChatGPT &#x1F937).
    
</p>
<p>
    Well, a family of models that has had a lot of success in the past few years
    are neural networks, which are within the family of piecewise-linear models &#x1F4C9
    <a href="" ng-click="scrollToElement('footnote-2')">[2]</a>.
    The problem is that there is no way to control the number of linear regions of
    neural networks.
    In this project, we found a way to learn piecewise-linear models from the data
    that have few regions and a straightforward relationship
    with their parameters.
    For this, we used a regularizer that enforces sparse second-derivatives (don't mind this too much),
    and restricted ourselves to a family of models that is made of "lego pieces" called box splines.
    In the following image you can see, on the left, the lego pieces that make up our models
    and, on the right, the a learned model which results from summing shifted versions of this lego
    pieces with different heights.

    Abstract: <br>
    We develop a novel 2D functional learning framework that employs a sparsity-promoting
    regularization based on second-order derivatives. Motivated by the nature of the regularizer, we restrict the
    search space to the span of piecewise-linear box splines shifted on a 2D lattice. Our formulation of the
    infinite-dimensional problem on this search space allows us to recast it exactly as a finite-dimensional one
    that can be solved using standard methods in convex optimization. Since our search space is composed of
    continuous and piecewise-linear functions, our work presents itself as an alternative to training networks that
    deploy rectified linear units, which also construct models in this family. The advantages of our method are
    fourfold: the ability to enforce sparsity, favoring models with fewer piecewise-linear regions; the use of a rotation, scale and translation-invariant regularization; a single hyperparameter that controls the complexity of
    the model; and a clear model interpretability that provides a straightforward relation between the parameters
    and the overall learned function. We validate our framework in various experimental setups and compare it
    with neural networks.
    <br> <br>
    Conclusion: <br>
    We have introduced a method to solve two-dimensional learn-
    ing problems regularized with Hessian-nuclear total-variation
    (HTV) seminorm. The starting point of our work has been
    the observation that the HTV of (admissible) continuous and
    piecewise-linear (CPWL) functions has a closed-form expres-
    sion. Its computation, however, requires knowledge of the
    gradient and boundaries of each partition. To circumvent this
    drawback, we have formulated the problem in a search space
    consisting of shifts of CPWL box-splines in a lattice. By doing
    so, we are able to evaluate any model in the search space, as
    well as compute its HTV, from the values at the lattice points
    (model parameters). In particular, we showed that the latter
    can be computed with a three-filter convolutional structure;
    this allows us to discretize the problem exactly and to recast
    it in the form of the generalized least-absolute shrinkage-and-
    selection operator. Finally, we have demonstrated the sparsity-
    promoting effect of our framework via numerical examples
    where we have compared its performance with ReLU neural
    networks and radial-basis functions.
