    Abstract: <br>
    We develop a novel 2D functional learning framework that employs a sparsity-promoting
    regularization based on second-order derivatives. Motivated by the nature of the regularizer, we restrict the
    search space to the span of piecewise-linear box splines shifted on a 2D lattice. Our formulation of the
    infinite-dimensional problem on this search space allows us to recast it exactly as a finite-dimensional one
    that can be solved using standard methods in convex optimization. Since our search space is composed of
    continuous and piecewise-linear functions, our work presents itself as an alternative to training networks that
    deploy rectified linear units, which also construct models in this family. The advantages of our method are
    fourfold: the ability to enforce sparsity, favoring models with fewer piecewise-linear regions; the use of a ro-
    tation, scale and translation-invariant regularization; a single hyperparameter that controls the complexity of
    the model; and a clear model interpretability that provides a straightforward relation between the parameters
    and the overall learned function. We validate our framework in various experimental setups and compare it
    with neural networks.

    Conclusion: <br>
    We have introduced a method to solve two-dimensional learn-
    ing problems regularized with Hessian-nuclear total-variation
    (HTV) seminorm. The starting point of our work has been
    the observation that the HTV of (admissible) continuous and
    piecewise-linear (CPWL) functions has a closed-form expres-
    sion. Its computation, however, requires knowledge of the
    gradient and boundaries of each partition. To circumvent this
    drawback, we have formulated the problem in a search space
    consisting of shifts of CPWL box-splines in a lattice. By doing
    so, we are able to evaluate any model in the search space, as
    well as compute its HTV, from the values at the lattice points
    (model parameters). In particular, we showed that the latter
    can be computed with a three-filter convolutional structure;
    this allows us to discretize the problem exactly and to recast
    it in the form of the generalized least-absolute shrinkage-and-
    selection operator. Finally, we have demonstrated the sparsity-
    promoting effect of our framework via numerical examples
    where we have compared its performance with ReLU neural
    networks and radial-basis functions.
