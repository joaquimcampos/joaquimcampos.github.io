									<h2>Introduction</h2>

									<h3>The Four Noble Truths</h3>
									<p>
										All Buddhist philosophy and practice can be seen through the framework of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths" target="_blank">four noble truths</a>, the first teaching of the Buddha.
									</p>
									<p>
										The first noble truth is a diagnosis of our root disease: suffering or dissatisfaction. We suffer when we inevitably separate from our objects of desire or face unfavorable circumstances such as sickness, old age, and death. Even when things are "going our way", we still feel insecure because everything is in a constant process of change; whatever state we feel like we have grasped is bound to disappear, because the same causes and conditions that came together to produce it at some point are bound to separate at another <a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip bottom" data-tooltip="One of the main teachings of the Buddha is that 'All compounded phenomena are impermanent'. Something is compounded if it originated at some point through the coming together of causes and conditions.">1</a>.
										The first noble truth is a very direct, precise, and concise insight into our predicament: if we analyze things carefully, we see that all we actually want is to be happy and free from suffering (and maybe we want this not only for ourselves but also for others). This, the Buddha said, is to be understood, because if we wish to eliminate our ailment, we first need to acknowledge it&mdash;otherwise, we will never seek a cure.
									</p>
									<p>
										The second noble truth points out the causes of suffering: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_poisons">ignorance, attachment, and aversion</a>.
										The root problem here is ignorance, not knowing how things actually are (more on this later). Due to ignorance, we cling to desirable things and have aversion towards undesirable ones, and we get stuck in this cycle of thirst and either temporary relief or disappointment and depression. Nothing is ever enough for very long; we keep going back to searching for bandaids, constantly trying to pile up our house of cards hopelessly hoping that it will one day be complete and never fall again. Because we do not understand the causes of suffering, we look for happiness where it cannot be truly found: career, status, wealth, relationships, sex, praise, trips, drinking, etc. When we look at these things carefully, honestly, we have to acknowledge that they can never really solve the problem because they are&mdash;by their very nature&mdash;impermanent <a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip bottom" data-tooltip="One of the main teachings of the Buddha is that 'All compounded phenomena are impermanent'. Something is compounded if it originated at some point through the coming together of causes and conditions.">1</a>. Ignorance manifests as a belief that we are attaining the causes of happiness when we are in fact feeding and perpetuating the causes of suffering. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantideva" target="_blank">Shantideva</a> said: "We who are like senseless children shrink from suffering, but love its causes." Without understanding the causes of stress, a solution cannot be found.
									</p>
										The third noble truth is the truth of cessation. Here, the doctor tells us that it is possible for us to find a cure for our ailment (suffering or dissatisfaction), but for that we need to rely on their prescription: the fourth noble truth, the truth of the path.
									</p>
										In summary, if we are to be cured of suffering or dissatisfaction, we must first examine our predicament and acknowledge that we have a problem; second, we need to investigate the causes of our disease; third, we need to believe that it is possible to cure our ailment by eliminating its causes; finally, we need to take a medicine that actually eliminates the causes of dissatisfaction.
									</p>

									<h3>The View: An Antidote to Ignorance</h3>

									<p>
										Suppose we have been away from home for a long time&mdash;so much time in fact that we forgot where it is. Due to habit, we have conformed ourselves to driving in circles in an area that has become familiar to us, still believing our home is somewhere around. But, at some point, we have to face the fact that we might be searching in the wrong place; after all, we don't seem to have gotten any closer to finding our way back. We are ignorant about pretty much everything: we don't know exactly where to go, which means of transportation to use, what supplies we'll need for our journey, etc.. We really need a strategy!
									</p>
									<p>
										First, we have to get clear on where exactly our home is.
										We have been aimlessly going around for some time, so we might need to ask others for help. We might meet people on the road who have studied the map and are more well-traveled&mdash;they might have already found <i>home</i>. 
										Then, we need find a GPS system that actually gets us there. We want to get there as quickly as possible, so ideally this system should calculate the best route, help us avoid roadblocks, give us alternative routes when needed, and warn us of dangerous sections of the road. So we need to search for GPS systems on the market, read the reviews, and purchase a few. Then, we need to develop real trust that our GPS system is reliable by studying the manual and testing it out in shorter trips. (We are heading for a long journey, so we don't want to have a malfunctioning GPS.) Only then are we prepared to embark on the trip. Of course, the GPS does not suffice to get us there: we have to make the trip ourselves. And when we're on the road, we need to constantly improve our poor driving skills, learn how to avoid accidents and recover from them if they do happen, learn when to refuel, etc. Moreover, we need to remember to routinely look at the GPS, actually follow it, and recalibrate it if necessary.
									</p>
									<p>
										In this analogy, the philosophical view is the guide that proposes a destination and provides a GPS system, and the practice is the process of actually making the trip with all its joys and sorrows. In the words of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyentse_Norbu">Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche</a>, "The view not only gives us the reason to practice; it is also the result we seek to attain through practice. Furthermore, the view is also a safety railing this prevents us from going astray on the path. Without the view, the whole aim and purpose of Buddhism is lost. If we wish to reach a destination, it is fruitless to proceed aimlessly on the journey if we have not established our direction and destination. Likewise, meditation and action will not bear fruit unless we have established the view."

										Buddhism first proposes a destination: freedom from suffering for us and all sentient beings <a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip tooltip-narrow bottom" data-tooltip="This is actually a Mahayana destination (Cf. footnote).">2</a>. We are free to reject this proposal and try out other ones instead like trying to maximize pleasure and comfort in life, believing they will get us back home. But if we conclude such destination is a reasonable one, then we can rely on different GPS systems that were crafted and fine-tuned by Buddhist manufacturers through exhaustive studies of the terrain (mind and reality), proof tests, and field tests <a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip bottom" data-tooltip="One of the proof tests of the view in Buddhism is reasoning and logic. Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche says, 'Strictly, from the point of view of Buddhist logic, reasoning is even more important than the Buddha's words, because the Buddha's words are open to interpretation.'">3</a>.
									</p>

									<h3>Madhyamaka Philosophy</h3>
									<p>
										<i>Note: This section heavily draws from <a href="https://siddharthasintent.org/publications/introduction-to-the-middle-way/" target="_blank">Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche's commentary on the Madhyamakavatara</a></i>, sometimes quotes it verbatum.
									</p>

									<p>
										The view of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhyamaka">Madhyamaka</a>, otherwise known as the view of <a href="https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Emptiness">Emptiness</a>, is the skeleton of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana" target="_blank">Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na Buddhism</a>&mdash;the most common form of Buddhism in the world. Understanding of this view is said to directly cut through ignorance and therefore uproot the causes of suffering
										<a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip tooltip-narrow bottom" data-tooltip="This is symbolized by the image of Manjusri with its wisdom sword (cf. footnote).">4</a>. From the point of view of Madhyamaka, enlightenment is equivalent to a complete and stable experiential recognition of emptiness.
									</p>
									<p>
										We perceive phenomena as being solid, independent, permanent, and as having an essence, a 'self'. But, according to Madhyamaka philosophy, this is an illusion: if we analyze phenomena logically and experientially, we verify that  nothing can be said to exist independently, solidly, and permanently, and that all compounded phenomena lack intrinsic existence, a truly existing 'self'. Because how we perceive reality is not in accordance with how it actually is, we suffer.
										
										<!-- because of this, we have attachment towards some objects and aversion towards others, which propels the feedback loop of suffering and causes of suffering. -->
									</p>
									<p>
										
										These ideas seem preposterous at first; when we look at a table, we have a deep-seated certainty that we know what a table is. But when we study Madhyamaka philosophy, we find that when we are pressed for further explanations, we are left with nothing substantial: what seemed so certain becomes like sand slipping through our fingers. This process is like the peeling of a banana tree: first, it looks very solid, but when you start "peeling it", layer after layer, you end up finding there is nothing inside.
									
										As Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche puts it, "When we say 'this is a tent', what are we referring to? Is it this iron beam, or this piece of fabric? If we cut one piece and then another, we will not find the tent. There is no base, but we still have an idea that this is a tent, and we cling to it."
									</p>
									<p>
										The purpose of Madhyamaka philosophy is to dismantle our assumptions through an extensive and precise sequence of questionings and argumentations. <i>Is the tent the collection of its parts? Is it a support for its parts?  Is it a specific configuration of its parts? It it defined by its function (<i>e.g.</i>, a place where you can things)?</i> Each of these possibilities is logically disproved, such that we are left with the completely counter-intuitive conclusion that what we call a "tent" does not have a substantial existence; there is no real, solid substance there; it is a mere conceptual imputation. The existence that we ascribe to the tent that completely falls apart under scrutiny. What seemed so real, when analyzed, becomes like shaving foam, a bubble, a mirage. Not knowing this is ignorance. As Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche states, "Here we are talking about the situation where there is nothing solidly existent in reality, but your mind thinks there is something. That is avidya [ignorance]. So, in buddhism, ignorance has nothing to do with evil or misunderstanding. It is a hallucination, a mirage. [..] When we look at this teabag, our habitual mind thinks that this is a solidly existent external phenomenon. We think there really is a teabag there, which is separate from my mind that thinks, 'This is a teabag'. But according to buddhism, especially the Mahayana, there is no teabag if there is no knower, one who gives this type of label. So this is why, if I ask you whether you see the cup of tea that I see, you would normally say yes, but in fact you never see my idea of this cup of tea&mdash;you only see your idea of this cup of tea."
									</p>
									<p>
										Of all conceptual imputations, there is a particular one to which Madhyamaka given special attention because it is said to be the root of all suffering: the idea of "I". We have a sense that we have a solid, independent, permanent, truly existing self. We see the world in relation to the "I", craving object that give us pleasure and comfort and having aversion towards those that cause us pain. This propels the feedback loop of suffering and causes of suffering. 
										As Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche states: "The Madhyamika finds that the problem is ignorance, the ego, clinging to the self as truly existent. Simply speaking, this selfishness is the problem. Then it embarks on a thorough study of where this selfishness comes from. Can we actually overcome it? Can we overcome it permanently, or just for a few years? Is it really something that we can purify? For questions like this, there are studies, meditations and contemplations. And based on these, all sorts of religious-sounding terms and techniques came, such as the notions of guru, discipline, ethics, generosity, and so on."
									</p>
									<p>
										Apart from rejecting the extreme of existence (eternalism), Madhyamaka also rejects the extreme of non-existence (nihilism), of both existence of non-existence, and neither. Therefore it is called the philosophy of the Middle Way.
										It does not merely say a flower is not truly existent. It also disproves the statement that it is non-existent, and so on. As Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche states, "When the Mahayana says a flower does not exist, it actually means that the flower is free from the four extremes: it is not existent, nor is it non-existent, nor both existent and non-existent, and not neither existent nor non-existent. If you understand this, you will not ask questions like
										'How can the Mahayana say this table does not exist? I can see it.'"
										Because there is no truly existing base for appearances, anything can arise, just like a mirror is able to reflect anything because what it shows is not truly there.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Philosophy of Madhyamaka is an interesting GPS. It doesn't actually tell you where to go. Instead, it tells you all the paths where you should not go (spoiler: if we are not awakened, we are in one of these places). It doesn't tell you what ultimate reality is (<i>i.e.</i>, how things actually are); it just tells you what is is not&mdash;that it is free from the extremes of existence, non-existence, both, and neither, free of all conceptual extremes.

										If you are working to espace all of these, then you are on the right path back home.
									</p>
									<p>
										In the Madhyamika, we are studying the cause that makes a society dysfunctional. Why is our society not good? What is it that makes everybody go through endless pain? Economists talk of business recessions and failures in economic policy as the cause. Here in the Madhyamika we are also trying to understand what makes this society not function properly, both temporally and permanently.

									<h2>This Project, Simply Explained</h2>
									<p>
										In this project, I am doing a deep dive into the view of emptiness, reading classical texts and commentaries on the topic, and contemplating on them. My first goal is to understand as best as I can this philosophy, deepening my understanding of Buddhist philosophy and psychology. I would also like to compare it with western philosophical views such as those of <a href="https://www.thecollector.com/david-hume-personal-identity/">David Hume</a> and Derek Parfit. Second, I would like to find ways of conveying the acquired knowledge in an accessible, effective, and engaging way to the general public. This will likely be done through a series of narrated animation videos. I will explore interactive visual examples. For this, I will drink from western psychology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function">neuroscience</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images">art</a>. I will explore different related concepts such as optical and cognitive illusions, timelapses, recontextualization and metaphor. I will explore the role of space in perception; How objects are also defined by space -> Taoist idea.
										Third, to explore  applications in the modern world, and
										to view modern challenges through the lens of the studied concepts.

										Holism: Philosophy, pyschology, spirituality, education.
										This is a topic that touches different fields in many forms.
										Aware of the dangers of a philosophy that is not aligned with reality (e.g. Speciecism).

										Communicating emptiness in an accessible, effective, and engaging way to the general public, using modern examples.

										Finding ways to make the connection between a lack of insight into emptiness and suffering salient.

										To explore applications in the modern world, and to view modern challenges through the lens of the studied concepts.

										In fact, money and banks work with the same agreement as NFTs, Bitcoin etc.
										If more than 20% of the people wanted to withdraw money from the bank, the system would collapse.
										There is no base.

										Consult experts for clarification (Justin, Khenpos, Wulstan Fletcher, )


										Animated videos using technology. Producing videos: 2 levels of complexity: Philosophical and more didactical videos.
										Interactive examples.
										
										Tools to explain and to exemplify, to shake our assumptions.

										(Focus on efficiency and certainty rather than breadth. depth first approach.)

										Exploring different teaching/communication methods (skillful means) to convey the important points.
