									<h2>Introduction</h2>

									<h3>The Four Noble Truths</h3>
									<p>
										All Buddhist philosophy and practice can be seen through the framework of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths" target="_blank">four noble truths</a>, the first teaching of the Buddha.
									</p>
									<p>
										The first noble truth is a diagnosis of our root disease: suffering or dissatisfaction. We suffer when we inevitably separate from our objects of desire or face unfavorable circumstances such as sickness, old age, and death. Even when things are "going our way", we still feel insecure because everything is in a constant process of change, and whatever state we feel like we have grasped is bound to disappear, because the same causes and conditions that came together to produce it at some point are bound to separate at another <a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip bottom" data-tooltip="One of the main teachings of the Buddha is that 'All compounded phenomena are impermanent'. Something is compounded if it originated at some point through the coming together of causes and conditions.">1</a>.
										The first noble truth is a very direct, precise, and concise insight into our predicament: if we analyze things carefully, we see that all we actually want is to be happy and free from suffering (and maybe not only for ourselves, but also for others). This is to be understood, because if we wish to eliminate our ailment, we first need to acknowledge it&mdash;otherwise, we will never seek a cure for it.
									</p>
									<p>
										The second noble truth points out the causes of suffering: ignorance, attachment, and aversion.
										The root problem here is ignorance, not knowing how things actually are (more on this later). Due to ignorance, we cling to desirable things and have aversion towards undesirable ones, and we get stuck in this cycle of thirst and either temporary relief or disappointment and depression. Nothing is ever enough for very long; we keep going back to searching for bandaids, constantly trying to pile up our house of cards hopelessly hoping that it will one day be complete and never fall again. Because we do not understand the causes of suffering, we look for happiness where it cannot be truly found: career, status, wealth, relationships, sex, praise, trips, drinking, etc. When we look at these things carefully, honestly, we have to acknowledge that they can never really solve the problem because they are&mdash;by their very nature&mdash;impermanent <a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip bottom" data-tooltip="One of the main teachings of the Buddha is that 'All compounded phenomena are impermanent'. Something is compounded if it originated at some point through the coming together of causes and conditions.">1</a>. Ignorance manifests as a belief that we are attaining the causes of happiness when we are in fact growing and perpetuating the causes of suffering; as Shantideva said: "We who are like senseless children shrink from suffering, but love its causes." Without understanding the causes of stress, a solution cannot be found.
									</p>
										The third noble truth is the truth of cessation. Here, the doctor tells us that it is possible for us to find a cure for our ailment (suffering or dissatisfaction), but for that we need to rely on their prescription: the fourth noble truth, the truth of the path.
									</p>
										In summary, if we are to be cured of suffering or dissatisfaction, we must first examine our predicament and acknowledge that we have a problem; second, we need to investigate the causes of our disease; third, we need to believe that it is possible to cure our ailment by eliminating its causes; finally, we need to take a medicine that actually eliminates the causes of dissatisfaction.
									</p>

									<h3>Ignorance</h3>

									<p>
										Because ignorance&mdash;not knowing how things are&mdash;is the root cause of all suffering, Buddhism aims to deeply understand the mind and reality.
										Before going somewhere, we first need to get clear on where exactly we want to go, and then find a GPS system that actually gets us there&mdash;hopefully, as quick as possible; if it can help us avoid roadblocks and warn us of dangerous sections of the road, even better. And it would not be wise to do long trips without first developing real trust in the GPS system by studying the manual and maybe testing it out in shorter trips. Only then, are we prepared to embark on the trip. Of course, the GPS does not suffice to get us there: we have to make the trip ourselves. And when we're on the road, we need to constantly improve our poor driving skills, learn how to avoid accidents and recover from them if they do happen, and learn when to refuel. Moreover, we need to remember to routinely look at the GPS and recalibrate it if necessary.
										In this analogy, the philosophical view is the guide that helps us choose our destination and provides a GPS system
										<a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip bottom" data-tooltip="In Buddhism, the view is commonly crafted using reasoning and logic. Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche says, 'Strictly, from the point of view of Buddhist logic, reasoning is even more important than the Buddha's words, because the Buddha's words are open to interpretation.'">2</a>, and the practice is the process of actually making the trip.

										DKR: "The view not only gives us the reason to practice; it is also the result we seek to attain through practice. Furthermore, the view is also a safety railing that prevents us from going astray on the path. Without the view, the whole aim and purpose of Buddhism is lost. If we wish to reach a destination, it is fruitless to proceed aimlessly on the journey if we have not established our direction and destination. Likewise, meditation and action will not bear fruit unless we have established the view."

									<h3>Madhyamaka Philosophy</h3>
									<p>
										<i>Note: This section heavily draws from <a href="https://siddharthasintent.org/publications/introduction-to-the-middle-way/" target="_blank">Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche's commentary on the Madhyamakavatara</a></i>.
									</p>

									<p>
										The view of Madhyamaka (The Middle Way) or the view of Emptiness is the skeleton of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana" target="_blank">Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na Buddhism</a>&mdash;the most common form of Buddhism in the world. Understanding of this view is said to directly cut through ignorance, so it is a strong antidote to the causes of suffering
										<a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip tooltip-narrow bottom" data-tooltip="This is symbolized by the image of Manjusri with its wisdom sword (cf. footnote).">3</a>.
										Buddhist philosophy concludes that we suffer because we do not see reality as it is. We perceive phenomena as being solid, independent, permanent, as having an essence, a "self", and cling to it as such.
										<!-- We actually believe that we can step on the same river twice.  -->
										<!-- If we go to a river this year and visit the same river next year, we believe that the river is the same as last year, but this is an illusion; the river we saw last year is gone. As the saying goes "You can't step in the same river twice": This applies to all compounded phenomena. -->
										But, according to the view of emptiness, if we analyze phenomena logically and experientially, we verify that  can be said to exist independently, solidly, and permanently, and that all compounded phenomena <a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip bottom" data-tooltip="One of the main teachings of the Buddha is that 'All compounded phenomena are impermanent'. Something is compounded if it originated at some point through the coming together of causes and conditions.">1</a> lack intrinsic existence, a truly existing 'self'. These ideas seem preposterous at first; we look at a table, and we are 100% sure that we know what the table is. Well, Madhyamaka philosophy dismantles our assumptions through an extensive and precise sequence of questionings and argumentations. <i>Is the table the collection of its parts? Is it a support for its parts?  Is it a specific configuration of its parts? It it defined by its function (<i>e.g.</i>, a place where you can things)?</i> Each of these possibilities is logically disproved, such that we are left with the completely counter-intuitive conclusion that what we call a "table" is a baseless idea, a mere conceptual imputation; the existence that we ascribe to the table that completely falls apart under scrutiny. It actually has no substantial existence. It is like shaving foam, a bubble, a mirage. The things we cling to and have aversion towards are just fabrications of mind.

										Similarly, when we say, “this is a tent”, what are we referring to? Is it this iron beam, or this piece of fabric? If we cut one piece and then another, we will not find the tent. There is no base, but we still have an idea that this is a tent, and we cling to it. That is dagdzin.
									</p>
									<p>
										Another idea that we don't analyse is the idea of "I", "me", and "mine". Clinging to an illusory self is said to be the root of all suffering, so dispelling the idea of a solid, independent, permanent self is a central endevour of Madhyamaka.
									</p>
									<p>
										Madhyamaka is the middle way because 
										it states that ultimate reality (the one that is established through reasoning) is free from extremes like existence and non-existence, eternalism and nihilism, and so on. It is free of all conceptual extremes.

										Buddha: "form is like a bubble and feeling is like a bubble" (essenceless)

										When the Mahayana says a flower does not exist, it actually means that the flower is free from the four extremes: it is not existent, nor is it non-existent, nor both existent and non-existent, and not neither existent nor non-existent. If you understand this, you will not ask questions like
										"How can the Mahayana say this table does not exist? I can see it."
										
										The Buddha also said that "perception is like a mirage, and karmic formation is like a banana tree". A banana tree has many layers, and when you look at it from outside, it looks very solid. But it is all just layers of skin. As you peel layer after layer of skin, you end up finding that there is nothing inside. There is no real solid substance, as it is all made out of skin.
										
										It is free from all extremes of existence, non-existence, both, and neither. Whichever side you go to, Chandrakirti is there, saying, "No, this isn't it!"

										We fixate on characteristics and cling to the idea of subject and object. Clinging to self and phenomena as truly existent is the root of all suffering.
										
										However, things are not non-existent.
										Because there is no base, anything can arise (like in a mirror).
									</p>
									
									<p>
										But here we are talking about the situation where there is nothing solidly existent in reality, but your mind thinks there is something. That is avidya. So, in buddhism, ignorance has nothing to do with evil or misunderstanding. It is a hallucination, a mirage. People think that dualism refers to bad/good, ugly/beautiful and so on. Yes, these are also dualism. But there are no separate solid entities such as subject and object&mdash;they are one. When you do not know that, and you divorce subject and object, then it becomes dualism. Dualism is also ignorance. When we look at this teabag, our habitual mind thinks that this is a solidly existent external phenomenon. We think there really is a teabag there, which is separate from my mind that thinks, “This is a teabag”. But according to buddhism, especially the Mahayana, there is no teabag if there is no knower, one who gives this type of label. So this is why, if I ask you whether you see the cup of tea that I see, you would normally say yes, but in fact you never see my idea of this cup of tea&mdash;you only see your idea of this cup of tea.
									</p>
									<p>
										In the Madhyamika, we are studying the cause that makes a society dysfunctional. Why is our society not good? What is it that makes everybody go through endless pain? Economists talk of business recessions and failures in economic policy as the cause. Here in the Madhyamika we are also trying to understand what makes this society not function properly, both temporally and permanently.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Madhyamika finds that the problem is ignorance, the ego, clinging to the self as truly existent. Simply speaking, this selfishness is the problem. Then it embarks on a thorough study of where this selfishness comes from. Can we actually overcome it? Can we overcome it permanently, or just for a few years? Is it really something that we can purify? For questions like this, there are studies, meditations and contemplations. And based on these, all sorts of religious-sounding terms and techniques came, such as the notions of guru, discipline, ethics, generosity, and so on.
									</p>
									<p>
										The two schools of Madhyamika have many similarities. They both believe that the cause of samsara is attachment to the self, or ego, as truly existent. And both agree that production from the four extremes has to be refuted in order to destroy the mind that clings to the truly existent self of phenomena and the person.

									<h2>This Project, Simply Explained</h2>
									<p>
										In this project, I am doing a deep dive into the view of emptiness, reading classical texts and commentaries on the topic, and contemplating on them. My first goal is to understand as best as I can this philosophy, deepening my understanding of Buddhist philosophy and psychology. I would also like to compare it with western philosophical views such as those of <a href="https://www.thecollector.com/david-hume-personal-identity/">David Hume</a> and Derek Parfit. Second, I would like to find ways of conveying the acquired knowledge in an accessible, effective, and engaging way to the general public. This will likely be done through a series of narrated animation videos. I will explore interactive visual examples. For this, I will drink from western psychology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_approaches_to_brain_function">neuroscience</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images">art</a>. I will explore different related concepts such as optical and cognitive illusions, timelapses, recontextualization and metaphor. I will explore the role of space in perception; How objects are also defined by space -> Taoist idea.
										Third, to explore  applications in the modern world, and
										to view modern challenges through the lens of the studied concepts.

										Holism: Philosophy, pyschology, spirituality, education.
										This is a topic that touches different fields in many forms.
										Aware of the dangers of a philosophy that is not aligned with reality (e.g. Speciecism).

										Communicating emptiness in an accessible, effective, and engaging way to the general public, using modern examples.

										Finding ways to make the connection between a lack of insight into emptiness and suffering salient.

										To explore applications in the modern world, and to view modern challenges through the lens of the studied concepts.

										In fact, money and banks work with the same agreement as NFTs, Bitcoin etc.
										If more than 20% of the people wanted to withdraw money from the bank, the system would collapse.
										There is no base.

										Consult experts for clarification (Justin, Khenpos, Wulstan Fletcher, )


										Animated videos using technology. Producing videos: 2 levels of complexity: Philosophical and more didactical videos.
										Interactive examples.
										
										Tools to explain and to exemplify, to shake our assumptions.

										(Focus on efficiency and certainty rather than breadth. depth first approach.)

										Exploring different teaching/communication methods (skillful means) to convey the important points.
