									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>

									<h3>The Four Noble Truths</h3>
									<p>
										All Buddhist philosophy and practice can be seen through the framework of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths" target="_blank">four noble truths</a>, the first teaching of the Buddha.
									</p>
										The first noble truth is a diagnosis of the disease we actually want to eradicate: suffering or dissatisfaction. We suffer when we inevitably separate from our objects of desire or face unfavorable circumstances; we suffer when we inevitably get sick, grow old, and die. Even when things are "going our way", we still feel insecure because things are in a constant process of change; whatever state we feel like we have grasped is bound to disappear, because the same causes and conditions that came together to produce it at some point are bound to separate at another.
										The first noble truth is a very clear diagnosis: If we analyze things carefully, we see that all we are trying to do is be happy and free from suffering. This is to be understood: if we don't acknowledge our ailment, we won't try to find a cure.
									</p>
									<p>
										The second noble truth points out the causes of suffering: ignorance, attachment, and aversion.
										The root problem here is ignorance, not knowing how things actually are (more on this later). Due to ignorance, we cling to desirable things and have aversion towards undesirable ones, and we get stuck in this cycle of thirst and either temporary relief or disappointment and depression. Nothing is ever enough for very long; we keep going back to searching for bandaids, constantly trying to pile up our house of cards hopelessly hoping that it will one day be complete and never fall again. Because we do not understand the causes of suffering, we look for happiness where it cannot be truly found: career, status, wealth, relationships, sex, praise, trips, drinking, etc. When we look at these things carefully, honestly, we have to acknowledge that they can never really solve the problem because they are&mdash;by their very nature&mdash;impermanent. Ignorance manifests as a belief that we are attaining the causes of happiness when we are in fact growing and perpetuating the causes of suffering; as Shantideva said: "We who are like senseless children shrink from suffering, but love its causes." Without understanding the causes of stress, a solution cannot be found.
									</p>
										The third noble truth is the truth of cessation; here, the doctor tells us that it is possible for us to find a cure for our ailment (suffering or dissatisfaction), but for that we need to rely on their prescription, the fourth noble truth, the truth of the path.
									</p>
										In summary, if we are to be cured of suffering or dissatisfaction, we must first examine our predicament and acknowledge that we have a problem; second, we need to investigate the causes of our disease; third, we need to believe that it is possible to cure our ailment by eliminating its causes; finally, we need to take a medicine that actually eliminates the causes of dissatisfaction.
									</p>
									<h3>Madhyamaka: The Philosophy of the Middle Way</h3>
									<p>
										Because ignorance&mdash;not knowing how things are&mdash;is the root cause of all suffering, Buddhism aims to deeply understand the mind and reality from an intelectual and experiential perspective in order to gain insight into how it works, discover and eliminate the causes of suffering, and foster the causes of happiness. For this, the philosophical view is extremely important because it sets the GPS coordinates for what we want to achieve or realize; it helps us develop discernment. And as Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche says,  "Strictly, from the point of view of Buddhist logic, reasoning is even more important than the Buddha's words, because the Buddha's words are open to interpretation."
									</p>
									<p>
										In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana">Mahayana Buddhism</a>&mdash;the most common form of Buddhism in the world&mdash;, the view of Madhyamaka (The Middle Way) is the most fundamental philosophy. Its understanding is said to be a direct antidote to the causes of suffering.
									</p>
									<p>
										We see things as being independent, solid, permanent. We look
									</p>
									<p>It could be the absolute Madhyamika, the Dharmakaya, which is the absolute nature free of all conceptual extremes.</p>
									<p>Non-duality is simply realising the meaning of the Madhyamika, and thus being free from extremes like existence and non-existence, eternalism and nihilism, and so on.
									</p>
									<p>
										In the Mulamadhyamaka-karikas, Nagarjuna also said “Therefore all compounded things are illusions”. For example, if you go to a river this year and next year you go to the same river you might say “I saw this same river last year”. But that is an illusion – it is not true! The river you saw last year is gone, dried up, drunk by the whales and sharks! So Nagarjuna says that all compounded phenomena are illusions – this is incredible! So the conclusion is that as long as there is impermanence, there is suffering. This is a special assertion of the Mahayana. In the Vaibhashika and lower schools, they believe that something can change every instant yet not be suffering
									</p>
									<p>
										Dendzin (bden ’dzin): When you look at this pen, you cling to it as a truly existent pen. If someone says it is spaghetti, you will say, “No, it is a pen”. This is dendzin.
									</p>
									<p>
										Tsendzin (mtshan ’dzin) is fixation towards characteristics. As long as there is an object and a subject, there is tsendzin. There are no details like whether it is truly existing or not. But this is a very rough explanation.
									</p>
									<p>
										Most of us find such renunciation difficult, as we feel we’re missing out on the good things – we  long for the pleasant and beautiful aspects of samsara, which we still believe truly exist out there.  But it is something quite different to renounce samsara based on the view – the view of  emptiness – which holds that both the desirable and futile aspects of samsara are just fabrications  of mind. With the view of emptiness, we can see that renouncing samsaric life is not something  painful. It’s not really a penance or sacrifice, because we realise that there is, in reality, nothing  to sacrifice.

										Western ethical views are usually summarized into three main theories: deontology, consequentialism,
										and virtue ethics
										<a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip tooltip-narrow top" data-tooltip='There are theories which do not fit into this classification like ethics of care and pragmatic ethics.'>1</a>
										<a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip tooltip-narrow top" data-tooltip='Each of the theories mentioned here encompasses several sub-theories. For the purposes of this piece, I will make a few rough generalizations.'>2</a>.
									<!-- </p>
									<p> -->
										The first, deontology, holds that ethics should be based on moral norms (categorical rules of prohibition or permissiveness) and not on the potential or actual consequences of an action.
										For example, deontologists would generally hold that the act of killing an inocent person
										is never right, independently of any "positive" effects that it might have (such as saving five other people).
										In this sense, "the Right is said to have priority over the Good" <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/#DeoThe" target="_blank">[3]</a>.
									<!-- </p>
									<p> -->
										The second, consequentialism, holds that ethics should be based not on moral norms but on
										what maximizes the "greater Good" (for which definitions might vary).
										According to this system, moral choices should be weighed in a context-aware manner according their potential consequences;
										an action such as killing might be considered wrong
										in a given situation but right in another, depending on whether it has
										"positive" or "negative" consequences.
									<!-- </p>
									<p> -->
										Finally, virtue ethics holds that what matters for determinining the moral character
										of an action is not whether it follows "good" moral norms or leads to a greater ratio
										of "positive" vs "negative" consequences,
										but whether it is aligned with wholesome virtues such as compassion, honesty, etc.;
										an action such as killing might be considered wrong if it is arises from
										an unvirtuous attitude (<i>e.g.</i>, hatred), but be right if it is motivated by
										an virtuous one (<i>e.g.</i>, compassion).
									</p>

										When the Mahayana says a flower does not exist, it actually means that the flower is free from the four extremes: it is not existent, nor is it non-existent, nor both existent and non-existent, and not neither existent nor non-existent. If you understand this, you will not ask questions like “how can the Mahayana say this tent does not exist? I can see it”. Chandrakirti will say it is not existent but also not non-existent. To our normal mind, ‘not non-existent’ means that it is sort of existent, but then Chandrakirti tells us that’s not it either. Whichever side you go to, Chandrakirti is there, saying, “No, this isn’t it!” That is why it is called the Middle Way. And after all this, Nagarjuna says that a learned one should not even remain in the Middle Way! 
									</p>
									<p>
										Selflessness of person, selflessness of phenomena.
									</p>
									<p>
										Clinging to self and phenomena as truly existent is the root of all suffering.
									</p>
									<p>
										When we say “this is a cup”, you are asking whether beyond ‘cup’ there is something that we can then refer to as a cup. According to Chandrakirti, that is zhi mé (gzhi med), there is no such thing. It is a complete hallucination. There is no base, but you take it as a base and think ‘this is me’. Here we come to the seven-point analysis of the chariot, in which Chandrakirti tells us that there is no base, but we hallucinate that there is a base and say, “this is a chariot”. Similarly, when we say, “this is a tent”, what are we referring to? Is it this iron beam, or this piece of fabric? If we cut one piece and then another, we will not find the tent. There is no base, but we still have an idea that this is a tent, and we cling to it. That is dagdzin.
									</p>
									<p>
										Indeed, the Buddha taught them about the second selflessness, the selflessness of phenomena, as we can see from the following quotation. He said that “form is like a bubble and feeling is like a bubble”, meaning they are essenceless, that they have no substantial existence. There is no true existence, no reality in there. The Buddha also said that “perception is like a mirage, and karmic formation is like a banana tree”. A banana tree has many layers, and when you look at it from outside, it looks very solid. But it is all just layers of skin. As you peel layer after layer of skin, you end up finding that there is nothing inside. There is no real solid substance, as it is all made out of skin. This quotation also says that consciousness is like a magical illusion.
									</p>
									<p>
										But here we are talking about the situation where there is nothing solidly existent in reality, but your mind thinks there is something. That is avidya. And that something is dag, and clinging to it is dzin. Dag is almost like a self. For example, Jakob thinks his girlfriend is beautiful. Here, ‘beautiful’ is the dag.And when others are near her, Jakob is jealous: this attachment, this clinging, is the dzin.So, in buddhism, ignorance has nothing to do with evil or misunderstanding. It is a hallucination, a mirage. People think that dualism refers to bad/good, ugly/beautiful and so on. Yes, these are also dualism. But there are no separate solid entities such as subject and object – they are one. When you do not know that, and you divorce subject and object, then it becomes dualism. Dualism is also ignorance. When we look at this teabag, our habitual mind thinks that this is a solidly existent external phenomenon. We think there really is a teabag there, which is separate from my mind that thinks, “This is a teabag”. But according to buddhism, especially the Mahayana, there is no teabag if there is no knower, one who gives this type of label. So this is why, if I ask you whether you see the cup of tea that I see, you would normally say yes, but in fact you never see my idea of this cup of tea – you only see your idea of this cup of tea.
									</p>
									<p>
										Third seal: "All phenomena are without truly existing characteristics, without a truly existing ‘self’"
									</p>
									<p>
										In the Madhyamika, we are studying the cause that makes a society dysfunctional. Why is our society not good? What is it that makes everybody go through endless pain? Economists talk of business recessions and failures in economic policy as the cause. Here in the Madhyamika we are also trying to understand what makes this society not function properly, both temporally and permanently.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Madhyamika finds that the problem is ignorance, the ego, clinging to the self as truly existent. Simply speaking, this selfishness is the problem. Then it embarks on a thorough study of where this selfishness comes from. Can we actually overcome it? Can we overcome it permanently, or just for a few years? Is it really something that we can purify? For questions like this, there are studies, meditations and contemplations. And based on these, all sorts of religious-sounding terms and techniques came, such as the notions of guru, discipline, ethics, generosity, and so on.
									</p>
									<p>
										The two schools of Madhyamika have many similarities. They both believe that the cause of samsara is attachment to the self, or ego, as truly existent. And both agree that production from the four extremes has to be refuted in order to destroy the mind that clings to the truly existent self of phenomena and the person.
