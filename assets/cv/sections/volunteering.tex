\begin{itemize}
    \item In 2022, I spent one month teaching science, English, and mathematics to elementary and middle school students at Sammena School in Arusha, Tanzania.
    \item Since 2021, I have been volunteering with \href{https://www.casa-apoioaosemabrigo.org/casa-a-associacao/}{CASA} whenever I am in Lisbon. The goal of this organization is to help alleviate the suffering of people experiencing homelessness. 
\end{itemize}
