									<h2>Germano de Sousa</h2>
									<p>
										<a href="https://www.germanodesousa.com/en/" target="_blank">Germano de Sousa</a> is a leading Portuguese healthcare company with extensive experience in laboratory medicine. The group employs 1,600 professionals and operates more than 550 collection centers and 22 laboratories specializing in clinical pathology, anatomical pathology, and genetics. Additionally, it collaborates with various clinics and hospitals, including institutions in countries such as Spain, Angola, and Kenya.

										As an example of the services the company provides, a patient may visit one of the company's collection sites or affiliated hospitals to have blood drawn for cholesterol, triglycerides, and iron level analysis. The samples are processed in the laboratory, the results are provided to the patient, and either the patient or their insurance company is billed accordingly.

									<h2>This Project, Explained</h2>
									<p>
										I was initially approached by one of the company owners because of my experience with AI. They were interested in exploring how the recent developments in the field could be further integrated into their business. However, during our conversations, I became aware of larger operational and technological challenges that the company wanted to address. As a result, I proposed expanding increase the scope of a possible collaboration to tackle these more pressing issues. This eventually lead the company to entrust me with conducting an independent evaluation to diagnose their operational and technological problems and recommend solutions.
										
										The first step was to gain a good understanding of the business. To achieve this, I visited the relevant departments---from the laboratories to the collection sites---and conducted interviews with staff and top management. During this phase, I focused on the following key tasks:
										<ul>
											<li>Understanding the essential components of the company workflow, from patient-staff interaction to the transportation of samples to the lab, their subsequent analysis, and the billing process with insurance companies.</li>
											<li>Becoming familiar with the technological infrastructure, such as the front-office and back-office software systems.</li>
											<li>Analyzing the workflows for data acquisition and processing.</li>
											<li>Understand error-correction processes.</li>
											<li>Reviewing the company's communication workflows.</li>
											<li>Analyzing user experience and support mechanisms.</li>
											<li>Paying close attention to healthcare confidentiality and the handling of private patient data.</li>
											<li>Evaluating disaster-recovery scenarios.</li>
										</ul>
										
										The second step was conducting a comprehensive assessment. During this phase, I:
										<ul>
											<li>Identified inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and other challenges in the operational and informatics systems.</li>
											<li>Explored opportunities for digital transformation and automation of manual processes</li>
											<li>Identify missed opportunities for data acquisition and value extraction from existing datasets.</li>
											<li>Suggested the increase in data-based strategyzing, informed data analytics and visualization.</li>
											<li>Suggested incorporating industry best practices.</li>
											<li>Investigated the use of innovative solutions such as AI.</li>
											<li>Proposed visualization of important markers and system triggers derived from collected data to improve problem prevention and resolution.</li>
											<li>Suggest improvements to workflow standardization and code documentation.</li>
											<li>Recommended enhacements to user experience and support mechanisms.</li>
											<li>Consider environmentally sustainabile practices, particularly through route management (transportation) and digitization.</li>
											<li>Proposed improvements to the communicatin workflows.</li>
											<li>Proposed the adoption of modern services like Jira for project-management.</li>
										</ul>
										
										I delivered monthly presentations to top management, discussing findings and providing actionable recommendations to guide strategic decisions, 
										
										This was a holistic work, combining both technical analysis with interpersonal engagement.
										
										The project culminated in the writing of a RFP.
