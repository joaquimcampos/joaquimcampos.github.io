									<h2>Introduction: Western Ethics</h2>

									<p>
										Western ethical views are usually summarized into three main theories: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology">deontology</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism">consequentialism</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics">virtue ethics</a>
										<a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip tooltip-narrow top" data-tooltip='There are theories which do not fit into this classification like ethics of care and pragmatic ethics.'>1</a>
										<a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip tooltip-narrow top" data-tooltip='Each of the theories mentioned here encompasses several sub-theories. For the purposes of this piece, I will make a few rough generalizations.'>2</a>.
										The first, deontology, holds that ethics should be based on moral norms (categorical rules of prohibition or permissiveness) and not on the potential or actual consequences of an action.
										For example, deontologists would generally hold that the act of killing an inocent person is never right, independently of any "positive" effects that it might have (such as saving five other people). In this sense, "the Right is said to have priority over the Good" <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/#DeoThe">[3]</a>. The second, consequentialism, holds that ethics should be based not on moral norms but on what maximizes the "greater Good" (for which definitions might vary). According to this system, moral choices should be weighed in a context-aware manner according their potential consequences; an action such as killing might be considered wrong in a given situation but right in another, depending on whether it has "positive" or "negative" consequences. Finally, virtue ethics holds that what matters for determinining the moral character of an action is not whether it follows "good" moral norms or leads to a greater ratio of "positive" vs "negative" consequences, but whether it is aligned with wholesome virtues such as compassion, honesty, etc.; an action such as killing might be considered wrong if it is arises from an unvirtuous attitude (<i>e.g.</i>, hatred), but be right if it is motivated by an virtuous one (<i>e.g.</i>, compassion).

									<h2>This Project, Simply Explained</h2>
									<p>
										This project addresses the  classification of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana">Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na Buddhism</a> (MB) into the western subdivisions. This is a tricky subject because MB contains elements from all three categories&mdash;for example, deontology is present in the form of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_precepts">five precepts</a> (commitments to abstain from killing, stealing, etc.), virtue ethics is present in the form of the <a href="https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Six_paramitas">six perfections</a> (generosity, discipline, etc.), and a consequentialist attiude is found in the <a href="https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Bodhisattva">bodhisattva</a> goal of leading all sentient beings to enlightenment. This fact raises questions of compability, precedence, and interpretation: Are there virtuous actions that require breaking the precepts (such as lying in order to save someone's life)? Are virtuous actions always aligned with what leads to awakening of all sentient beings? How do we make sense of precepts in a virtue-ethics framework? How do we make sense of both precepts and virtue in a consequentialist framework? This project explores such questions.
									</p>
									<p>
										In this work, I first discard the claim that precepts&mdash;the deontological elements&mdash;are absolute in MB by giving several examples from the Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na literature where explicit recommendations are made in favor of breaking the precepts when a different course of action is more beneficial for others; furthermore, I also explore accounts of occasions when highly-realized beings intentionally broke the precepts. Then, I turn towards the virtue ethics vs consequentialism discussion.
										The virtue ethics position defines wholesome (virtuous) actions as those which are arise from wisdom, non-attachment, and non-aversion. Defenders of the virtue ethics classification argue that although virtuous actions have a natural affinity with enlightenment, they are valuable <i>per se</i>, and that a consequentialist classification of MB is not viable because in MB "the ends do not justify the means".
										
										MB consequentialism, on the other hand, can be associated to an utility function that is the cumulative progress of all sentient beings towards enlightenment, <i>i.e.</i>, the elimination of the roots of suffering, namely ignorance, attachment, and aversion.
										It rests upon the four noble truths <a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip tooltip-narrow bottom" data-tooltip='The truth of suffering, the truth of cause of suffering, the truth of cessation, and the truth of the path.'>3</a>, the Bodhisattva vow&mdash;the commitment to become fully awakened in order to free all sentient beings from suffering&mdash;, and the concept of skillful means
										<a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip bottom" data-tooltip='Methods or teachings that are tailored to a particular audience, taking into account their beliefs, level of understanding, and predispositions, in order to make progress towards awakening more expedient.'>4</a>. According to this framework, Buddhism is morally objective---in each situation, there are actions which are objectively morally preferable to others. This objectivism takes into account the whole situation---the subjects involved, the environment, the context, etc. An action <b>A</b> is morally preferable to an action <b>B</b> if it gets all sentient beings closer to awakening.
									</p>
									<p>
										I argue against the proposal of Damien Keown and Peter Harvey, classifying MB into the virtue ethics category, both philosophically and resorting to textual sources that indicate otherwise.

										I argue that "virtue ethics defenders" are taking the second noble truth of the truth of cause of suffering, and detaching them from their original purpose. Then they assume it as a definition, taking it as an axiom, obscuring the reality that it is in fact an answer to the question of what leads to awakening and eradicates suffering.

										Although I also defend that in Buddhist Ethics virtuous actions do not just have an affinity towards the consequentialist goal, they are actually fully compatible with it, because according to this framework they are precisely defined as what increases the utility function. Therefore, there is no need to worry about "ends justifying means", because no unwholesome means are conducive to wholesome ends and vice-versa. <a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip bottom" data-tooltip='But when it comes to the precepts&mdash;as stated before&mdash;some truly wholesome actions might require overriding them (e.g., lying, or even killing).'>5</a>
									</p>
									<p>
										In Buddhism, given the collapse of the notion of "self" and "other", ethics take place in a much larger context. Internal states such as thoughts and states of mind—which we consider as having no direct effect on the other—now become pertinent. For example, the thought of killing someone is considered unwholesome while deliberately putting such thought down is considered wholesome. Every action of body, speech, and mind is encompassed within Buddhist ethics.
									</p>
									<p>
										Finally, I use the consequentialist lens to clarify how the different aspects of MB, including precepts (deontological elements) and virtues, fit within this classification, as well as to consider the role that skillful means, and spiritual guides play in MB with regards to the navigation of the optimization landscape.
