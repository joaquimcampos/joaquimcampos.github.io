									<h2>Introduction: Western Ethics</h2>

									<p>
										Western ethical views are usually summarized into three main theories: deontology, consequentialism,
										and virtue ethics
										<a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip tooltip-narrow top" data-tooltip='There are theories which do not fit into this classification like ethics of care and pragmatic ethics.'>1</a>
										<a href="#footnotes" class="tooltip tooltip-narrow top" data-tooltip='Each of the theories mentioned here encompasses several sub-theories. For the purposes of this piece, I will make a few rough generalizations.'>2</a>.
									<!-- </p>
									<p> -->
										The first, deontology, holds that ethics should be based on moral norms (categorical rules of prohibition or permissiveness) and not on the potential or actual consequences of an action.
										For example, deontologists would generally hold that the act of killing an inocent person
										is never right, independently of any "positive" effects that it might have (such as saving five other people).
										In this sense, "the Right is said to have priority over the Good" <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/#DeoThe">[3]</a>.
									<!-- </p>
									<p> -->
										The second, consequentialism, holds that ethics should be based not on moral norms but on
										what maximizes the "greater Good" (for which definitions might vary).
										According to this system, moral choices should be weighed in a context-aware manner according their potential consequences;
										an action such as killing might be considered wrong
										in a given situation but right in another, depending on whether it has
										"positive" or "negative" consequences.
									<!-- </p>
									<p> -->
										Finally, virtue ethics holds that what matters for determinining the moral character
										of an action is not whether it follows "good" moral norms or leads to a greater ratio
										of "positive" vs "negative" consequences,
										but whether it is aligned with wholesome virtues such as compassion, honesty, etc.;
										an action such as killing might be considered wrong if it is arises from
										an unvirtuous attitude (<i>e.g.</i>, hatred), but be right if it is motivated by
										an virtuous one (<i>e.g.</i>, compassion).

									<h2>This Project, Simply Explained</h2>
									<p>
										This project addresses the  classification of Mah&amacr;y&amacr;na Buddhism (MB) into the three western ethical categories. Such problem does not yield an immediate solution because MB contains elements from all these three categories, raising questions of compability, precedence, and interpretation of the different elements. For example, deontology is present in the form of the five precepts (commitments to abstain from killing, stealing, etc.), virtue ethics is present in the form of the six perfections (<i>e.g.</i>, generosity), and a consequentialist attiude is found in the goal of leading all sentient beings to enlightenment.
									</p>
									<p>
										I propose a consequentialist framework for MB whose utility function is the cumulative progress of all sentient beings towards enlightenment, <i>i.e.</i>, the elimination of the roots of suffering, namely ignorance, attachment, and aversion.
										I argue against the proposal of Damien Keown and Peter Harvey, classifying MB into the virtue ethics category, both philosophically and resorting to textual sources that indicate otherwise.
										Moreover, I show how the deontological and virtue ethics elements of MB ethics can be viewed through and be fully encompassed within the consequentialist framework.
										Finally, I consider the utility function through the lens of Optimization Theory and consider the role that precepts and virtues, skillful means, and spiritual guides play in MB with regards to the navigation of the optimization landscape.
